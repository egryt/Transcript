>> Bianca Gandolfo: So now that you have some foundational experience with implementing data structure from scratch, it's time to apply those to some common interview questions. And so what we're gonna do right now is investigate different themes and different types of questions that you'll see for these data structures. And kind of talk about things to keep in mind, then it's up to you to go and implement them.

[00:00:27]
And there's solutions online, and to practice these types of problems. So let's take a look, these are some common questions about stocks and queues. Actually, let me take a step back and talk about where I have accumulated these themes and questions and the resources that I used. So how I first started learning data structures and algorithms was through MOOCs, so like college classes on data structures and algorithms and things like that.

[00:00:54]
Reading books like Cracking the Coding Interview, kind of takes a less academic approach, and I think that's a lot more digestible. So a lot of my questions are from themes that I found in Cracking the Coding Interview, websites like InterviewBit, LeetCode, and GeeksforGeeks is another one that I like.

[00:01:18]
It's like a crowd sourced website. So basically what I did in preparation for this class is I went through all the questions on these platforms that were under the particular data structure umbrella. And then that kind of like went through them and try to pick up themes and different approaches.

[00:01:45]
And so this one what I wanna do is kind of talk to you about what I found and different ways to approach these kind of problems. So that when you see them, and you'll see an adaption of these in a variety of different ways that you'll have an idea of where to start.
